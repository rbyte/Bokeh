alpha does not react to variance
 -> combine mean and variance adjustment calculation!

set initial dSlider to mean & var
	find way to calc vcr from given var

maybe:
distribution slider vertical: there are still flaws
correlate size more with z-index
performance improvement
	Gauss Radius Reduzieren in feFilter
	Use Radial Gradient Stop Approximation
by default, log n steps
interactivity (mouse playing)
	hover highlights particle in dSliders
pick individual particles in distribution slider and drag their value
