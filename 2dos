sliders on right side: write title into svg
right side: reduce transition duration
css: disable mouse cursor change on dSliderSVG text + z-index low!
background sliders are buggy

maybe:
during dragging, menu should not unhover in case of overshoot
added particles overlay white rects
keyboard only option
background colour picker: make simple click working
size with  + - and wheel! -> update slider too

save as png -> link, resolution selection?
alpha dSlider pattern: turn to real pattern def
distribution slider vertical: there are still flaws
removing particles does not remove their blur filters in defs
correlate size more with z-index
performance improvement
	Gauss Radius Reduzieren in feFilter
	Use Radial Gradient Stop Approximation
by default, log n steps
interactivity (mouse playing)
	hover highlights particle in dSliders
pick individual particles in distribution slider and drag their value
