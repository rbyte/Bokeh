MAYBE:
chromium: frame white rects overlay title
info: and what the hell this is in the first place
on download svg, chromium shows it, but without the blur applied
open sans light into css
chromium: dSlider cursor during drag is not a crosshair - fix
display lock symbol if menu item is clicked
improve calculations (additions) to look more like bokeh bg image
lightness?
during dragging, menu should not unhover in case of overshoot
keyboard only option
background colour picker: make simple click working
size with  + - and wheel! -> update slider too
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas/Drawing_DOM_objects_into_a_canvas
save as png -> link, resolution selection?

distribution slider vertical: there are still flaws
removing particles does not remove their blur filters in defs
correlate size more with z-index
performance improvement
	Gauss Radius Reduzieren in feFilter
	Use Radial Gradient Stop Approximation
by default, log n steps
interactivity (mouse playing)
	hover highlights particle in dSliders
pick individual particles in distribution slider and drag their value
